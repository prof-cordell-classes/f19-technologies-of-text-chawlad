## Questions or Observations

1. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 1
_Reading: Octavia Butler, “Speech Sounds” (1983)_The reading transports the reader into a world with dying verbal communication, language, intellectual impairment, and the rise of obscene gestures and actions. The descriptions, such as children seeking books and logs for fire, makes me think of how this imaginary world lost it’s roots in the passing down of written information and hence the sharing of knowledge. I think this sic-fi piece was very compelling and gave a vivid snapshot of a world with loss in communication, mediums, and sensory abilities of humans would be.
2. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 2
_Reading: Annette Vee, “Introduction: Computer Programming as Literacy” from Coding Literacy: How Computer Programming is Changing Writing (2018)_All digital literacies (today) have computer programming in common;All digital literacies operate as a complex ecology;This takes me back to our previous discussion of “the content/message is not important, because the medium is the message.”The digital literacies themselves are not important, but their complex ecology is.To reference a quote, p. 11, "Coding literacy points to the underlying mechanisms of the literacy of computer programming rather than the instrument on which one performs it.” 
3. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 3
_Reading: Amaranth Borsuk, “The Book as Object” from The Book (2018)_p. xiii “The book is a fluid artifact whose form and usage have shifted over time under numerous influences: social, financial, and technological.”p. 24 “Writing’s form and materials developed in dialogue with one another, even in this early stage, shaping the form of the book to both writers and readers.”This idea connected with our previously discussed idea of how all of ‘new’ media is “refashioning of old media” and “the introduction of new media is never entirely revolutionary.”_The Book_ and its historical context from various culture truly dates back to the founding of text, the representation of information, and the mediums that still act as foundation to our ways of interpretation, and the distribution of text and knowledge.
