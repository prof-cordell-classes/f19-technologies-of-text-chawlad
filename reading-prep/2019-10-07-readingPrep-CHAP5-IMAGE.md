## Questions or Observations

1. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 1

Blake’s technique "allowed for a more calligraphic writing style and a harmony between reading and looking, rather than relegating text and image to separate pages.”
While industrial printers had a ‘divide and conquer’ approach to maximise speed and efficiency, Blake had an artistic and expressive approach towards books.
The former is appropriate for mass production, and later as unique/limited art. The two are different types of resources, functionally different books, making direct comparisons difficult to decipher.


2. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 2

"Making the page into a stage on which language performs.”

Artists including Mallarmé had a specific purpose, context and audience for their medium (books). The artistic inclination of his work is portrayed in the codex. I think the codex is rightfully a political tool and can be used for whatever purpose the author/creator/printer or person in control desires. Till the necessary elements of the art can survive within the bounds of the codex, one can present a compelling combination of expressionistic techniques.


3. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 3

In the 21st century, we see elements beyond illustrations or graphics as part of a modern ‘artists book.’ The broad and dynamic definition of ’the book’ raises the question whether the use of auditory elements/moving images in modern books is resulting in a blur/interweave of distinct and separate forms of representation?
