# Lab Report: Multisensory Reading

#### Dipshika Chawla

## Process Description


For this lab we learned about the history of, and multisensory experiences of blind reading. In teams of 3, we circled around the room and attempted to read the text raised on 3d printed plastic. We looked at 5 different exhibits and attempted to gauge the topic, genre, or any relevant and identifiable details about the text. Our inexperience with this form of reading was very evident in our lack of progress and lack of substantial clues about what the exhibits convey or state. The blocks of 3d printed raised text were concealed with wooden trays from the letterpress lab, making the sense of touch our only permissible and activated sense in the reading process. My team, like many others, had various small observations - many of which were proven false after the raised text was revealed. We did notice the shape of the 3d blocks resembling that of an open codex, as this is how the computer scanned and produced these 3d printed replicas of codices, but with raised text. I successfully identified one of the texts as not english, which was revealed to be in moon type. However, apart from this, we had no concrete understanding of any of the themes and contexts of the readings, proving to us our limited reach and ability to ‘read’ in this form. This activity highlighted the dynamic definition of reading, as what is reading to a sighted person, does not translate into the ability to read the same information, in the same way as a non-sighted person (i.e. exclusively using the sense of touch.)


## Observations


Personally, this activity involved a deep sense of contemplation and empathy as we experienced the affordances and limitations of technologies that exist within the realm of reading for the blind. The inability to support the ‘reading’ task with any sort of visual aid was frustrating as this is something unusual and perhaps alien for many of us. Although the 3d printed blocks were sophisticated exhibits, they were difficult for us to decipher, given the different cognitive and sensory engagement we practice versus the kind this activity required. It was more common in the past for people to lose sight as a result of disease, war, or ageing and the fact that the blind had no access to reading till the 18th century puts things into perspective in our 21st century environment.

In addition to the sense of frustration, I was intrigued by the various imagery that was part of the exhibits we saw. A blind person could have lost vision, been born sighted, or be partially blind. It is hard for me to understand how there is no distinction between the resources available to people based on their degree of disability. We also discussed this when talking about a blind person’s ability to imagine a dog, let alone be able to ‘read’ one based on the raised lines in a book. It raises the question of who is the best person to design and oversee the authoring and creation of such resources. While a sighted person is a valuable resource in the physical oversight, visual alignment and perfection of such a book, perhaps a blind person is in the best position to guide and sign off on the reliability and accuracy of content. Eventually, if something cannot be read by its audience, does it truly belong in the piece of work? If not, what is the best way to convey the same message? By making these (assistive) changes, are we distorting the message entirely?


## Analysis


In _The End of Books_ by Octave Uzanne, Julius Pollock glorifies the idea of vegetarianism and how the premise of the same will “accurately portion out” nutriment, which is argued by John Pool as “all Utopic.” Though a far-reaching parallel, I notice this disbelief in the idea of standardisation of experience and activities, such as eating in this example and the clear distinction between technology for the able and disabled - one tagged as normative and the other as assistive or ’special.’ Time has heightened the inherent bias we carry, in terms of how all-eating or all-reading simply cannot be homogenous. It’s the same idea as the variances in our diet are difficult or even impossible to uproot, and so are our reading practices. The vision of ‘same for all’ is highly utopic in nature. 

The excerpt emphasises on the end of books and predicts technologies that will follow.

> If by books you are to be understood as referring to our innumerable collections of paper, printed, sewed, and bound in a cover announcing the title of the work, I own to you frankly that I do not believe (and the progress of electricity and modern mechanism forbids me to believe) that Gutenberg’s invention can do otherwise than sooner or later fall into desuetude as a means of current interpretation of our mental products.

Despite the degree of truth in this prediction, I believe the foundational aspect of Gutenberg’s invention makes us prone to rely on books, their ways, and their approach as our primary understanding of text, reading, and who has access to it. “Traditionally, books are visual objects” saidby Andrew Leland in his episode _The Universal Page._ We subconsciously ascribe vision and sight as a precursor to the art and activity of traditional reading. In addition to our discussions of the dynamism of the term ‘reading’, this is reflected in Uzanne’s piece as the people of the 19th century foresee the rise of hearing as a new and profound course of ‘reading’ and as humans’ primary intake of information. This idea is seen in the quote,

> Printing, which since 1436 has reigned despotically over the mind of man, is, in my opinion, threatened with death by the various devices for registering sound which have lately been invented, and which little by little will go on to perfection.

I think Uzanne’s piece allows us to take a step back and successfully view reading in the lens of a multisensory practice that evolves and achieves new forms, mediums, and interactions with the human mind and physical body. The superiority of visual reading is only a result of Gutenberg’s invention and its highly entwined presence in our human systems - political, cultural, social, and personal. I believe the historic magnificence of books as visual, and in print form, defines the present significance of reading as a visual practice - engaging particularly the sense of sight.

Per my aforementioned point under the observations section, I resonated with Andrew Leland’s mention of:
> One blind critic pointed out, sighted designers [also] have a bad habit of “talking to the fingers in the language of the eyes.

Haüy printed the first machine-embossed book for the blind and his attempt to create a singular item for use by the blind and sighted reflects our dominant reliance on the traditional codex-format of information. Although his innovation was groundbreaking, it is still centred around the premise of the basic elements of the codex and the alphabet - one of the biggest hurdles of innovation can be simply to think out of such established structures and confines. Similarly, Howe’s invention of the Boston Line Type relied on raised letter books. In true contrast, Braille is an exceptional assistive technology but remains “inscrutable by sighted people.” These distinctions make it difficult to identify one superior, most inclusive, or ‘most assistive’ technology. It is not only a historic challenge to converge the reading experiences of the blind and sighted, but till date a challenge due to the visual nature of reading. As we move away from the paradigm of single-sense reading is when we can truly embrace multisensory reading as expressed in Uzanne’s work as well as Sari Altschuler and David Weimer’s _Touch This Page_ project. 

The repeated attempts at converging the ways of reading of the blind and sighted, and the omnipresence of traditional text and alphabet is accurately described as
> He [Howe] might have thought of it as universal, but it’s universal in that way that the colonizer thinks things are universal. It’s like you know these poor native peoples need educating and will try to bring them up to my level and make them like me.

Lastly, _All Technology Is Assistive: Six Design Rules on Disability_ brings together these ideas in a nutshell, as Sara Hendren expresses,
> Undoing the distinctions between design for disability and design in general yields a couple of benefits: it brings new attention to technologies that are profound in their use and impact on physical and political accessibility.

There is a need to cross-share findings and innovations from those for the disabled and presently able as this knowledge can not only optimize our experiences but open the door for improved, inclusive, and revolutionary technologies. This also reminds me of the modern idea of the various considerations and “what-ifs” that are built into code. Creators are required to account for multiple facets of human life and existence, but are not expected to be paralysed by the endless possibilities of users and situations that the technology will face. It’s our challenge to incorporate specially researched or targeted solutions, that are in fact feasible and logical solutions to the daily ‘impairments’ faced by extended groups of humankind.
