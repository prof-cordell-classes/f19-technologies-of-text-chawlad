1. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 1
I was excited to read about Pagan Kennedy’s works, history, and her highly unforeseen love for and expertise in zines. She stumbled across this form of writing and successfully broke out of the conforms of 'conventional writing’ and her ‘nov in prog’ however, I still think the idea of zines are form of writing is debatable - not purely due to the status quo but simply due to the different types of intellectual engagement and audiences.


2. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 2
The Zine Librarians’ _Code of Ethics_ reading was particularly interesting because it provided these guidelines that would expose people not only to the general best practices but also expose them to zine as a genre. I particularly liked the part saying ‘invite feedback’ which also brought me back to Kennedy’s iterative approach and the involvement of her friends and fellows.
