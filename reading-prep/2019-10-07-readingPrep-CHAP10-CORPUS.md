## Questions or Observations

1. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 1

It is intriguing how D’Ignazio and Klien extended the idea of “gender is a social construct” to the constructs of our technological ecosystem - which largely also overlaps with our "virtual social” ecosystem. I think it was very interesting how they made this connection and said how the binary of gender needs to be broken down in our social lives, while the binaries in data or computing need to be monitored by ‘feminist’ data analysts or rather any person with a broader perspective (although such people are usually incapable of making these contributions due to the seemingly high barriers of entry into the fields of computing and data)
They also mention how 'fugitive verses were defined as much by prose as by poetry.’ However, poems do seem to be more frequent ‘fugitive verses’ - why so and how does the ‘form’ in this case impact our expectations and reactions.


2. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 2

As mentioned in Cordell and Mullen’s work the 'fugitive verse' extended its definition to "poems that demonstrated the serial, circulatory, and recursive temporality” - that is an interesting observation given the predominance of newspapers as one of the primary outlets of information and knowledge. It directly makes me suspect the extent of ‘reliability’ embodied in the far-reaching themes and emotions that these poems evoke for large audiences. (e.g. Tired Mothers)


3. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 3
