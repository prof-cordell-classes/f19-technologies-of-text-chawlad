# Lab Report: Book Binding

#### Dipshika Chawla

## Process Description

We started the lab with a set of equipment and materials to create our Twitterbot Poetry booklets. We gathered three 8.5” by 11” letterpress printed sheets and learned more about the book binding equipment before working hands-on. Each student had an awl, pair of scissors, bone folder, needle, and metal ruler - all placed on a cutting mat labeled with various metrics and guiding lines in this intricate process. I learned a professional book binder uses many more tools, such as sandpaper, carpenters’ square, paste, cloth, station templates, etc, for improved precision, aesthetics, and ability to work with large volumes of paper to bind, our task was relatively simple and introductory in nature.

As the first step, we folded the sheets of paper in precise halves to achieve our desired folio-size. The cutting mat was helpful due to the grids and metrics, and after we were confident in the alignment of the edges, we proceeded to press down on the fold with a bone folder. The bone folder was very useful in getting that crisp fold on the paper without looking unequally pressed. I might have pushed the bone folder with more pressure than necessary, which resulted in the ink on the cover bleeding softly towards the bind - which definitely explained the need for meticulous craftsmanship when dealing with so many elements and moving parts, all of which are quite vulnerable. After folding all the sheets, we chose the sheet that would essentially be in the middle of the closed folio - the central page if the folio was held open as a book. We marked five equidistant stations on this sheet with a pencil, while laying the sheet flat on the cutting mat. After having an understanding of these 5 target points for our awl, we set the sheets on the piercing cradle and punched holes into them, making us ready to proceed with sewing. The sewing itself was fairly straightforward, however the sequence of holes to go through was one I struggled with. After a failed attempt at the same, I managed to create the final product that was our collective-effort souvenir from this _Technologies of Text_ course.

## Observations

In the next section of each report, you should in **2-3 paragraphs** move from a literal description of what you did in the lab to a more conceptual set of observations. In brief, you want to home in on those aspects of the lab that raised questions or prompted new insights into the textual technology we investigated in the lab activity. What new ideas occurred to you while working? What surprised, delighted, or frustrated you?

When taking into account previous labs and our progress through the course, I was very overwhelmed by the complexity of the book-making or rather text-distributing processes of the past. This is something I have surfaced previously, as the process is long, has various inputs of all kind (human effort, tools, environment, etc) and that is unusual in the the 21st century. The underlying work that goes into books is made evident when interacting so closely with the production process. Overall, I was surprised by the degree of speciality adopted as press shops, binders, and so on were separate businesses and individual identities. This is of irrelevance to most people as today we have comfortable access to books in physical and virtual forms, without having to give the upstream intermediaries and processes any thought or acknowledgment. 

The rise of text and book-making techniques injected various ideas into society and its perception of books. The different sizes of books such as folios and quartos seem like the first steps towards the modern ‘hierarchy of books’ we carry subconsciously (as we discussed in class). It’s interesting to think of the various sizes of books and how they influenced the perception of people beyond authors of the 19th century. While the folios and quartos and octavos coexisted, today, we ascribe certain sets of expectations from different sized books. Today, book sizes are directly connected to the functionality and expectation aspects, wherein people of the past were significantly more expressive and personal with regard to decisions about the physicality of books. The primary consideration is that of format, and how the format of the book drives perception and behaviour. Historically the format was defined by the number of folds but today it is more like the ‘norm’ in production and distribution of text that majority follow. It almost reminds me of Leah Price’s idea of how modern books are a result of the iterations, and the “changing environments” that books inhabited. 

## Analysis


In _Baxter’s Procrustes_, there is a very strong sense of book as object. The short story highlights various status symbols and preexisting environmental elements in which Baxter’s Procrustes was produced and published. 

The final section of each report should bring your work in the lab into direct, critical conversation with our readings. In **_3-4 paragraphs_**, you should connect your lab observations to ideas from readings assigned _in the given lab unit_. This prose need not be as formal as a research paper, but it should demonstrate careful thought and preparation. You should integrate the readings explicitly, if possible through direct quotation. Use this writing to experiment with intellectual pairings you think might be generative to your larger thinking and help you prepare for the class’ Unessay projects. Think of your lab reports as an evolving research paper, and take them as seriously as one.
