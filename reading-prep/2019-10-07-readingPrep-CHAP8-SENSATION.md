## Questions or Observations

1. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 1

Reading: The End of Books
> “That is all Utopia,” cried John Pool, the humorist.

This is when Pool was objecting the view of vegetarianism proposed by Pollock. Is standardization of experience (reading or eating) ‘all utopic’? Is it possible to effectively converge into one medium, how we interact with these fundamental elements across mankind? 

2. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 2

Reading: The Universal Page

Braille and similar technologies that help the blind read have advanced and still remain at the core of systematic education of the blind. I wonder how the education system for the blind, and its technologies, would differ if Hauy’s efforts were absent and the beginning of education of the blind was something unlike raised print. Braille still requires the accurate embossing and sensory touch to read, what is an approach that can be paperless like the kindle is for the sighted?

3. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 3

Reading: All Technology is Assistive

It is true that all technology is assistive and does that in varying degrees, but it is also primarily due to the nature of technology to be functional and aim to ease/solve a human problem or process. This stands for the point that technologies (including discoveries in disability studies) should cross-share knowledge for their common theme of problem-solving and ‘assistance.’
