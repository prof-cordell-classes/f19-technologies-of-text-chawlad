# Lab Report: Book Binding

#### Dipshika Chawla

## Process Description

We started the lab with a set of equipment and materials to create our Twitterbot Poetry booklets. We gathered three 8.5” by 11” letterpress printed sheets and learned more about the book binding equipment before working hands-on. Each student had an awl, pair of scissors, bone folder, needle, and metal ruler - all placed on a cutting mat labeled with various metrics and guiding lines in this intricate process. I learned a professional book binder uses many more tools, such as sandpaper, carpenters’ square, paste, cloth, station templates, etc, for improved precision, aesthetics, and ability to work with large volumes of paper to bind, our task was relatively simple and introductory in nature.

As the first step, we folded the sheets of paper in precise halves to achieve our desired folio-size. The cutting mat was helpful due to the grids and metrics, and after we were confident in the alignment of the edges, we proceeded to press down on the fold with a bone folder. The bone folder was very useful in getting that crisp fold on the paper without making it look unequally pressed. At one point I pushed the bone folder with more pressure than necessary, which resulted in some ink bleeding softly towards the edge of the cover, and this definitely explained the need for meticulous craftsmanship when dealing with so many elements and moving parts, all of which are quite vulnerable. After folding all the sheets, we chose the sheet that would essentially be in the middle of the closed folio - the central page if the folio was held open as a book. We marked five equidistant stations, along the fold, with a pencil while laying the sheet flat on the cutting mat. After having an understanding of these 5 target points for our awl, we set the sheets on the piercing cradle and punched holes into them, making us ready to proceed with sewing. The sewing itself was fairly straightforward, however the sequence of holes to go through was one I struggled to follow. After one failed attempt, I managed to create the final product that was our collective-effort souvenir from this _Technologies of Text_ course. Lastly, I trimmed the ends of the folio booklet to give it perfectly straight edges.

## Observations


When taking into account previous labs and our progress through the course, I was very overwhelmed by the complexity of the book-making or rather text-distributing processes of the past. This is something I have surfaced previously, as the process is long, has various inputs of all kind (human effort, tools, environment, etc), and heavy on intricate details and moving pieces - something unusual in the the 21st century given the speed and advancement of technologies in these processes. The underlying work in book production is evident when interacting so closely with the production process. Overall, I was reflecting on the degree of separation and specialisation adopted as press shops, book binders, and so on operated as separate operations with their individual identities. This is of irrelevance to most people as today we have comfortable access to books in physical and virtual forms, without having to give the upstream intermediaries and processes any thought or acknowledgment.

The rise of text and book-making techniques injected various ideas into society and its perception of books. The different sizes of books such as folios and quartos seem like the first steps towards the modern ‘hierarchy of books’ we carry subconsciously (as we discussed in class). It’s interesting to think of the various sizes of books and how they influenced the perception of people then and now. While the folios and quartos and octavos coexisted, today, we ascribe certain sets of expectations from different sized books. Today, book sizes are directly connected to the functionality and expectation aspect. The primary consideration is that of format, and how the format of the book drives perception and behaviour. Historically the format was defined by the number of folds but today it is more synonymous to ‘norm’ that majority follow.

## Analysis

In _Baxter’s Procrustes_, there is a very strong sense of book as object. The short story highlights various status symbols and preexisting environmental elements in which Baxter’s Procrustes was produced and published. This is reflected in the rather late discovery of the ‘wordless’ book but also the physical elements or __beauties of the volume__ of the book such as the __dark green morocco cover__ or the __cap and bells border.__ Books are undeniably a medium of creative expression and interpretation and was never been limited to the content itself. Chestnutt mentions the various parallels people drew between the physicality of Baxter’s Procrustes to Baxter and his work in terms of the themes and ideas. Baxter’s Procrustes is still recognised for its beauty and is __a sort of shrine for local worshipers of fine bindings.__ The modern expectation is for all books to be bound per expectation and functionality needs, but a Baxter’s Procrustes was closely affiliated with The Bodleian Club and had to uphold that status and exclusivity as part of it. Baxter’s personal attention and supervision of __the printing, binding, and delivery__ confirms the significance of the outcome of these activities. The collaborative approach between the __literary committee and Baxter__ involved sharing __views in regard to the bookmaking__ as well. Baxter reported the delay in book deliveries as __the binder [was] retaining them for some extra fine work__ which only reinforces my conceptions and the societal values around bookmaking at the time. The essay ends on a very profound note:

> Fine binding is a desideratum, and, for its cost, that of the Procrustes could not be improved upon.

Interestingly, though book production and printing was fairly standardised by this time, the same sense of expression of personal creativity, preference, and expression is echoed in Leah Price’s book as she says, “Different copies of the same edition were customized with different bindings.” Book purchasers bought books and consciously made the effort and investment in making it match their personal libraries. As explained by Leah Price, “one of [those] social conventions was the unstated agreement to ignore differences in binding and size and paper, to assume that for all intents and purposes these different objects were the same.”

Along the same line of thought, Jane Austen’s letter to her sister, Cassandra, also mentioned this sort of personal preference and opinion when speaking of books. Austen passionately states what she is reading at the moment and speaks down to society by saying

> They will not understand a man who condenses his thoughts into an octavo.

Additionally, in her letter from 1813 outrightly expresses, 

> Ladies who read those enormous great stupid thick quarto volumes which one always sees in the breakfast parlour there must be acquainted with everything in the world. I detest a quarto.

There is a strong sense of emotional connect with the physicality of books for authors of the 19th century such as Austen and the common man alike. This also makes me wonder if the modern conceptions of books, book sizes, binding, and the aforementioned ‘hierarchy of books’ find their foundations in many such opinions. The modern book, to me, is a result of the advances in ways of living, in addition to some triumphing opinions of the past that overruled certain others. It’s an interesting mix of social, cultural, and economic factors.
