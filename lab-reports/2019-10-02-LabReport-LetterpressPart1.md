# Lab Report: Letterpress I: Composition

#### Dipshika Chawla

## Process Description

Our aim for the two-part letterpress labs was to letter print our Twitterbot generated poetry. As for this lab, setting movable type was our first step to successfully letter pressing. We were briefed about the basics of the letter pressing technology, in terms of the process and necessary physical elements. With a range of fonts and sizes to choose from, we worked our ways through the classic California job cases of movable type in front of us. After learning how to place the rule bender, hold the compositor stick, and navigate the type case, we were preoccupied by the desire to perfect our arrangement of type. This seemingly straight-forward task soon demonstrated its nuances and challenges to amateurs like myself. I was convinced of the level of detail and precision setting movable type demands. As the lab progressed, I noticed the similar challenges faced by me and my peers - from filling blanks at the end of a sentence, to line spacing uniformly. It was satisfying to work with a nondigital technology and physically shuffle between hundreds of sorts to compose text with meaning. In the world of sophisticated word processors, we were familiar with some of the elements of typography (font, size, spacing, alignment, etc.), however, arranging every element by hand and conscious (mental and physical) effort was an interesting experience. It pushed me to replicate the mental image of the text in my mind on to the composing stick. To print poetry with our desired aesthetics, we were to quick identify the different typographic elements to keep in mind and visualise the final product, **but our medium was not Microsoft Word** and that was the true essence of the lab. I was simply drawn to the historic significance and revolutionary innovation that the letterpress technology and process exhibited.

## Observations

My first observation in this lab was triggered by the visual of multiple type cases and other equipment around the classroom. I was thinking about how spatially demanding and manual the process was. We discussed the multiple roles and contributors that existed in a printshop and I began to conceptually understand such break down of tasks, volume of activity (when the task is to print an entire codex, not 4-line poetry), and industrialised process. This was reflected in our conversations and guiding each other as best we could, with the support of the professor and a frequent operator of the letterpress. While I scrutinised every individual type for three reasons - better understand the physical attributes, envision the production with alloy metal and matrices, and most importantly to ensure it is the letter I intended to pick from the type case. My conscious activity of double-checking letters reminded me of compositors, who mastered these skills and often filled the shoes of both - spellcheckers and punctuators. This exercise was particularly intriguing because it reminded me of our brief ‘dead media’ conversation. The letterpress is a technology of the past and the jobs in a typical eighteenth century printshop have dissolved. Similarly, the concept of “scribes donating themselves to the industry of letters” remains in the pre-printing era. This idea constantly brought me in touch with the vast timeline and grandeur of technological advancements in history.

I think this hands-on experience with setting type was fun yet occasionally frustrating. As mentioned, the nondigital and historic beauty of the activity was significant. However, I was occasionally frustrated by the vulnerability of loose types, challenge of undoing mistakes, risk of running out of a certain type, and addressing blank spaces. Though these problems lingered in our exercise, I could only think about their gravity in larger print operations of the past. Addressing blank space was a personal struggle as I found myself searching for a combination of chunky types and finding workarounds for the blank space - a problem I am certain compositors handled with expert judgment.

## Analysis
A quote from Amaranth Borsuk’s _The Book_,

> The invention of printing was the culmination of invention of the navigable book.

I resonated with this idea particularly because of our discussion of the printing press enabling the mass production of standardised text. Many typographic elements we see in early manuscripts trickle down into the writing of scribes, but this carrying forward of norms and ideas is not limited to _content_. The **cross-generational influence of the medium and technology, and the iterative nature of innovation**, is evident as we discuss Gutenberg’s entrepreneurial approach towards combining existing technologies to create the letterpress. Similarly, we briefly discussed the Linotype machine for eliminating the need for letter-by-letter manual typesetting, and producing a line of type. The Linotype’s fundamental similarities to the letterpress further support my argument. From a contemporary perspective, the presence of terminology in word processing that originates from technology of the past was an interesting theme, for eg. uppercase, lowercase, stereotype, etc. To my surprise, this perfectly aligned with our first reading in the course of _Always Already New_ by Lisa Gitelman. Gitelman said,

> The introduction of new media is never entirely revolutionary.

And

> The success of all media depends at some level on inattention and blindness to the media technologies themselves in favour of attention to the phenomena, the context that they represent for users’ edification or enjoyment.  


In addition to the technological factors that influence textual technology, the scribal or rather humanist influence of typography is amplified when Amaranth Borsuk explains the roman and italic type considered as “humanist faces” because

> They emulate writing with a broad-nibbed pen, which produces strokes of varying thickness.

Such elements of hand written text have relayed in our technological environments. The "broad-nibbed pen” of the scribes is an absent element today, however it’s "strokes of varying thickness" still impact representation and interpretation of text today (even digitally).

I was interested in Gutenberg and his venture primarily because of my business background. The rise and industrialisation of print achieved the mass production and distribution of text. Popularisation of this specific medium contributed to the evolution of the perception of books. The impact is across areas of printing, copyright, and authorship. As said by Borsuk,

> The legal shift to conceiving of the book as content, rather than object, is virtually inseparable from its commodification.
The multi-faceted influence of technological, social, cultural, and legal factors of the past amalgamate to form the contemporary understanding of what we call **the book**
