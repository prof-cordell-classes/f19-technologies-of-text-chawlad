## Questions or Observations

1. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 1
The _What Football Will Look Like in the Future_ by Jon Bois was a very interesting piece to experience, rather than just read! It was intrigued by the form it employed and the visual elements that made it almost-psychedelic and futuristic of sorts. The calendar scroll was an interestingly embedded to maintain the essence of the story - all of which I found very engaging. 

2. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 2
Future Reading by Craig Mod is a very intricately analysed insight into the readerly worlds of the 20th and 21st century. I think the article surfaced many points that are at the core of this ToT course as well. I also sensed a very strong balance between emotion-driven analysis alongside a business perspective. The following quote reminded me of the classic ‘technology adoption’ curve that innovation classes involve:
>New technologies are easily dismissible
This stuck with me for being easily identifiable in our daily environment - it is a highly evidence-based claim.

3. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 3
The article also expressed a certain degree of disapproval of Amazon’s market dominance and position.
> It seems as though Amazon has been disincentivised to stake out bold explorations by effectively winning a monopoly (deservedly, in many ways) on the market.


I enjoyed reading the recommendations of how Amazon could bridge the gap between the reading experience of codices and digital books, however, I think those gaps are inherent to the form and ‘black hole’ like size of the Amazon Books Database. One can scan his/her bookshelf and intake various names and emotions - but with a digital bookshelf the size of Amazon - even the most drastic measures cannot give an avid reader a holistic view of their library.
