# Lab Report: Zine You Around

#### Dipshika Chawla

## Process Description

For the _Assemblage_ chapter of the course, we closely interacted with the Zine culture and collections of the late 90s, and attempted to create our very own zines for this lab. We had one of Northeastern University’s Archive Specialist, Molly Brown, present for this lab as a knowledgeable resource and guide through the process. For this lab, we used single sheets and folded them appropriately to create compact pocket-size 8-page zines. Molly brought dozens of old magazine issues that were available for us to use for our zines. At the beginning, I browsed various magazine issues and made note of which visuals, images, fonts, and such, called out to me the most. I wanted to make a simple yet thoughtful zine about something that I was familiar with. I started cutting little images and they all seemed to connect to my at-home life and activities. Shortly after gathering a handful cutouts, I realised I was leaning towards a theme of my personal day-to-day life - a big part of which is defined by the relationship I share with my roommates. This instantly gave me an idea to make a zine that gives an insight into our personalities and group dynamic. Most of the items pasted onto my zine come from three different issues of The New Yorker, and a few from other magazines. A scanned copy of the final product can be seen below.

## Observations

I think our exposure to the form and Kennedy’s work prior to creating our zines was of immense value as it helped me understand how to approach such an open-ended activity. I was delighted by the traditional connotations that the zine form carries. Although it is possible to digitally produce and distribute zines today, I enjoyed the hands-on cut-and-paste experience very much partly due to the beauty of repurposing existing art, but also due to the need to physically filter through so many magazine issues. I found myself seeking fun in the challenge and truly repurposing little comic strips and images. It reminded me of how glossy and colour print is expensive (even today) and significantly loses value after short periods on the shelf, making it an accessible and sustainable resource for zine creators of all time, especially the early 90s.

In terms of the process and final product, I was very excited to see my final product for how original, one-of-a-kind, emotive, and personalised it was. Although, all zines are not personal and emotive, I think there is a theme of non-conforming and self-driven content. The creators voice is distinct, identifiable, and consistent. This is something I noticed in many of the zines we looked at as part of the _Assemblage_ chapter and when we discussed the sense of trust in the community of zine consumers. From a historic standpoint, it is admirable yet risky for zine creators to distribute zines featuring topical or sensitive issues such as racism, women’s rights, politics, and so on. I think the form is empowering, creatively and ideologically, wherein it fosters a great extent of free speech and expression for artists. It was also inspiring to see the various ways in which zine creators weaved doodles, drawings, annotations, and text blocks together to create a versatile reading experience.

## Analysis

I drew significant inspiration for this lab from _Zine_ by Pagan Kennedy. Her book highlighted the various challenges she faced while longing fame and acceptance in the world of publishing and authoring. She mentioned how this desire soon shifted towards:
> hunger for community — a swirl of supportive people around me, a sense of belonging to something larger than myself, a family made of friends.

I think zines were a great outlet for creative and multifaceted personalities like Kennedy’s. Being academically credible in English and writing does make Kennedy a strong candidate to write for companies like _The Village Voice._ However, the zine creator requires a personality beyond that of an article publisher. An article in the voice, even an opinion piece, only voices the ideas demanded, moderated, and signed off by editors and such. Kennedy also mentions these confines that are imposed on individuals in the schooling environment as well
> By the end of my stay in grad school, I had stopped writing about the hipster demimonde and begun trying to produce “normal” fiction.

This quote reflects the evolution of Kennedy’s writing and how she could identify it as a disposition of her writing, to conform to the oridinary. Zines allowed Kennedy to revive her unique self and express the ideas she wanted and the way she wanted to.
> Once I discovered my ’zine, I no longer wanted to belong.

Although this has its affordances, the _Zine Librarians Code of Ethics_ offers very interesting guidelines and recommendations of how to work with and care for zines appropriately. In these, we see various zine nuances and sensitivities highlighted, that help understand the form and its creators. The reading features a very compelling argument to protect zine creators.
> Financially supporting zinesters by purchasing their creations can help sustain their ability to keep making zines.

While removing the intermediaries of editors and publishing companies, zinesters are vulnerable to lack of control over reproduction and redistribution, as well as financial inflow. Though relaying of ideas and the zine itself can prove beneficial and act as a form of word-of-mouth outreach - this is also seen in Pagan’s works as she was happy to meet new fans as a result of the loose controls around distribution and consumption. However, the same lack of control can be detrimental in terms of level of identification and accreditation attracted by the zine. For the modern era, as said in the _Code of Ethics_
> In the age of the Internet, at least one prospectively endangered population are zinesters themselves

Additionally, this type of refurbishing and reuse can be detrimental to the art itself. If a zine’s medium is core to its message, the digitisation can portray an entirely different reader experience. 
> Some zinesters also feel that context is important. This can mean the format – that it was meant to be on paper, and held in the hands – or it can mean that the zine “works” best when it is read as a whole product, rather than having one or a few pages excerpted or reprinted.
