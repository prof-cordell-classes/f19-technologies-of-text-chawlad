## Questions or Observations

1. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 1
The fundamental understanding/perception of material items is ever-changing. 

As stated in Leah Price’s book, “Earliest readers saw them [novels] as disposable single-use items that you didn’t want cluttering up your shelves once their brief life expectancy had elapsed, any more than you’d keep yesterday’s newspaper.”

What are some other significant shifts in our perception of books?

2. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 2

Leah Price said, “When David Mikics posits that “literature, music and art express; computers, by contrast, lead you in a step-by-step way,” he might as well take Ikea assembly leaflets to prove that paper leads in a step-by-step way.”

I think this is an oversimplified approach in attempt to fit print in the mould of “step-by-step” computational thinking. I would disagree with Price, and agree with Mikics for the reason that literature, art, and music always remain expressive, original, and creative, however, computation attempts to create in a step-by-step manner, with creativity as part of the scope merely in the instructions/code.

3. QUESTION/OBSERVATION 3
How did David Walker craft the combination of “the text’s unusual yet deliberate and meaningful typography”? How does a writer (in the 1800s) control the perceived meaning of unconventional punctuation?
